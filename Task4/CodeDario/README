Either run: 

TF_Classification_labeled_test.py

-> this will just predict the results with the labeled data. 

or

1) TF_Classification_labeled_unlabeled.py
2) TF_Classification_all_labeled_test.py

-> this will first predict the results of the unlabeled data, then a new training dataset is created and the real test data is predicted.
